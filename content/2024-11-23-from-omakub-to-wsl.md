Recently, I've had the opportunity to reconsider my **tech** choices and habits. Both **hardware** and **software**.  

At first, I finally got around revamping my old (like almost a decade old) [System76](https://system76.com/) [laptop](https://support.system76.com/service-manuals/pdfs/Galago/galp2-service-manual.pdf). Initially, thought to just upgrade to latest [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/), but this turned out to be bit of a bumpy ride, given how outdated it was.  

Next, recalled [DHH](https://dhh.dk/) just promoting an _Ubuntu_-based distro, [Omakub](https://omakub.org/), geared towards developers coming from the Mac to **Linux**. And I have to say it rocks. So many great things in there. Even if you're not inclined to leave the _Apple_ bubble, I'd recommend taking a look at its CLI [toolchain](https://manual.omakub.org/1/read/10/the-applications) and [dotfiles](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub), at the very least. Having loads of **[fun](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub/issues/284)** with this, and also finally managed to get my Linux laptop hooked up reliably to my similarly ancient Apple [Thunderbolt display](https://support.apple.com/en-us/112597) (still a solid screen with some dock-like hub capabilities, a sufficiently well-working webcam, and exceptionally good analog speakers built in).  

Then, got to choose a new work laptop. In the end, went with a _Lenovo_ [ThinkPad X1 Carbon](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx1/thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-12-14-inch-intel/len101t0083) (Gen 12) -- what a great machine. Maxed out most specs, like 64 gigs of RAM and a 2 TB SSD (but a less high-resolution display for battery life). Now, initial plan was to install Linux on it as well, as it came with **Windows** 11 Pro. While updating stuff like drivers, firmware and BIOS, thought why not actually giving it a spin. Having heard from DHH's [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odSJr7HZMEQ), he went down a similar path, spending some time on Windows while finding his way out Apple lock-in. With things like [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) it's become a seriously nice environment for developers, and the OS itself is a pretty pleasant window management system, getting out of the way, these days ([PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys?tab=readme-ov-file#microsoft-powertoys) FTW). Amusing how Apple and Microsoft appear to have swapped roles --- with MS actively supporting and [embracing open-source](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262103/microsoft-open-source-linux-history-wrong-statement) software.

So, am currently happy with this setup. In my home office having ThinkPad connected to my second screen, a good old _Dell UltraSharp_ 27-incher. Seamlessly toggling between Linux and Windows/WSL box via [USB switch](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Switcher-Computers-Keyboard-Splitter/dp/B0CLXYVM36). Keyboard-wise, am since what feels like an eternity using a _Matias_ [Quiet Pro](http://matias.ca/quietpro/mac/), and just got me a _Lofree_ [Flow84](https://www.lofree.co/products/lofree-flow-the-smoothest-mechanical-keyboard?variant=44741423169755) for on-the-go. Mouse-wise, I like _Logitech MX_ series. In terms of mobile devices, moved from an _iPhone_ (SE) over to a [Fairphone 5](https://shop.fairphone.com/fairphone-5). Also **Android** is pretty neat nowadays, but that's something for another time, I reckon.
