As I'm moving on to become a consultant, and eventually trainer,  
this blog is experiencing a breath of **new life**. 

In its current incarnation, it's moved from an [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-octopress) setup to one powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). 

Features like tags, comments, archive, _what-have-you_, may come (again) later -- or not.

Here's to [new beginnings](https://log.robi42.net/blog/2012/09/16/hello) :slightly_smiling_face:

**Side note:** Atom feed appears to also be broken now, is anyone still using these anyway?
