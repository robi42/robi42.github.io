> _The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; 
therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, 
and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague._<br/><br/> 
**Edsger W. Dijkstra** --- [ACM Turing Lecture 1972](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html)
